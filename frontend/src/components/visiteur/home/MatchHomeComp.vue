            <p>Meet Frosty</p>
            <p>
              Frosty is a handsome small male cat who was rescued in January
              when a citizen noticed him in her back yard.
            </p>
            <p>
              Frosty is extremely timid and is easily startled by sounds. He can
              be curled up in your lap, appearing totally relaxed, but is he
              hears a sound, he will jump out of your lap and hide under the
              lounge chair
